% 1. Variable Operations 
% a) Create a variable `radius` and assign it a value of 5.
r = 5 % Radius of circle
% b) Calculate the area of a circle with this radius and store it in a variable called `area`.
a = ... % area of circle
% c) Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in a variable called `circumference`.
% Calcualting the circumference of the circle
c = ... % circumference of circle
% d) Display the results with appropriate labels.
% display results to user
fprintf("For a circle of radius %f", r)
fprintf("The area is %f \n", a)
fprintf("The circumference is %f \n", c)
